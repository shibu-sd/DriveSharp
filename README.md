# DriveSharp
## Introduction
DriveSharp is a easy to use lightweight Android application which uses deep learning models and other mathematical models to determine whether they are closed or not.
Both eyes are judged separately. We have also designed a interface which allows the driver to add details such as the SOS numbers to which the 
SMS emergency message will be sent when the driver is detected as drowsy and a beep sound is also played in an attempt to alert the driver himself.

## Key Features
The user can :

* Can detect whether the driver is drowsy or not
* Can play an alert sound to wake up the driver when he/she is feeling drowsy
* Can send a custom SMS message to two numbers of the driver's choice when the driver drowsiness is detected
